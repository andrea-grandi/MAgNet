# Thesis Template – Overleaf

This repository contains a **LaTeX thesis template** designed to be easily uploaded and used on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), 
the online platform for writing scientific and academic documents in LaTeX.\
It is possible to link only one Overleaf account to the thesis project, which will have both read and edit permissions.

## Why use a template? 

- **Ready-to-use structure**: the template already includes the typical thesis layout (cover page, table of contents, chapters, bibliography).  
- **Preconfigured packages**: the most commonly required packages (e.g., `babel`, `amsmath`, `graphicx`, `hyperref`, etc.) are already included, so you don’t need to waste time searching for them or setting up the environment.  
- **Consistent style**: headers, numbering, formatting, and margins follow traditional university thesis standards.
