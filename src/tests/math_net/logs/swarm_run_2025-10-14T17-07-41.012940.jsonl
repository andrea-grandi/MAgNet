For the tangent circle to be tangent to the first circle, the distance from \\((h,k)\\) to \\((4,0)\\) must equal \\(r + 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(h - 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n   \\]\n   For the tangent circle to be tangent to the second circle, the distance from \\((h,k)\\) to \\((-4,0)\\) must equal \\(r + 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(h + 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the equations**:\n   Squaring both equations gives:\n   \\[\n   (h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (h + 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2\n   \\]\n\n   Since both equations equal \\((r + 1)^2\\), we can set them equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   (h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (h + 4)^2 + k^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the equation**:\n   Cancel \\(k^2\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   (h - 4)^2 = (h + 4)^2\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides:\n   \\[\n   h^2 - 8h + 16 = h^2 + 8h + 16\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   -8h = 8h \\implies -16h = 0 \\implies h = 0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substituting \\(h = 0\\)**:\n   Now, we substitute \\(h = 0\\) into one of the original distance equations:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{16 + k^2} = r + 1\n   \\]\n\n   For the second circle:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(0 + 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1\n   \\]\n   This gives the same equation, confirming \\(h = 0\\).\n\n7. **Circle passing through \\((0,5)\\)**:\n   The circle must also pass throug...
