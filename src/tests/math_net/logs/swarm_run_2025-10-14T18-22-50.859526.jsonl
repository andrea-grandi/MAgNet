Circle 2: Center at (-4,0) with radius 1, equation: \\((x + 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the distances from the point (0,5) to the centers of both circles:\n\n- Distance to Circle 1: \n  \\[\n  d_1 = \\sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + (5 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41}\n  \\]\n\n- Distance to Circle 2: \n  \\[\n  d_2 = \\sqrt{(0 + 4)^2 + (5 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41}\n  \\]\n\nFor a circle to be tangent to both circles, its radius \\( r \\) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n- For Circle 1:\n  \\[\n  r + 1 = d_1 \\implies r + 1 = \\sqrt{41} \\implies r = \\sqrt{41} - 1\n  \\]\n\n- For Circle 2:\n  \\[\n  r + 1 = d_2 \\implies r + 1 = \\sqrt{41} \\implies r = \\sqrt{41} - 1\n  \\]\n\nBoth conditions yield the same radius \\( r = \\sqrt{41} - 1 \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine how many circles can be constructed with this radius that are tangent to both given circles and pass through the point (0,5). \n\nThe centers of the tangent circles will lie on the line that is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the two given circles and passing through the point (0,5). The centers of the tangent circles will be located at a distance of \\( r \\) from the point (0,5) along this perpendicular line.\n\nSince the two given circles are symmetric about the y-axis, the tangent circles can be positioned on either side of the y-axis. Therefore, there will be two circles that satisfy the conditions: one on the left side of the y-axis and one on the right side.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: 2", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T18:23:13.242914"}
