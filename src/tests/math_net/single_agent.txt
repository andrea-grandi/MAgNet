To solve the problem, we need to find the number of circles that are tangent to both given circles centered at \((4,0)\) and \((-4,0)\) with radius 1, and also pass through the point \((0,5)\).

1. **Identify the centers and radii of the given circles**:
   - Circle 1: Center \((4,0)\), Radius \(1\)
   - Circle 2: Center \((-4,0)\), Radius \(1\)

2. **Determine the distance between the centers of the circles**:
   The distance between the centers \((4,0)\) and \((-4,0)\) is:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(4 - (-4))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(4 + 4)^2} = \sqrt{8^2} = 8
   \]

3. **Consider the circles tangent to both given circles**:
   Let the radius of the tangent circle be \(r\) and its center be \((h,k)\). For the tangent circle to be tangent to the first circle, the distance from \((h,k)\) to \((4,0)\) must equal \(r + 1\):
   \[
   \sqrt{(h - 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1
   \]
   For the tangent circle to be tangent to the second circle, the distance from \((h,k)\) to \((-4,0)\) must equal \(r + 1\):
   \[
   \sqrt{(h + 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1
   \]

4. **Set up the equations**:
   Squaring both equations gives:
   \[
   (h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2
   \]
   \[
   (h + 4)^2 + k^2 = (r + 1)^2
   \]

   Since both equations equal \((r + 1)^2\), we can set them equal to each other:
   \[
   (h - 4)^2 + k^2 = (h + 4)^2 + k^2
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation**:
   Cancel \(k^2\) from both sides:
   \[
   (h - 4)^2 = (h + 4)^2
   \]
   Expanding both sides:
   \[
   h^2 - 8h + 16 = h^2 + 8h + 16
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   -8h = 8h \implies -16h = 0 \implies h = 0
   \]

6. **Substituting \(h = 0\)**:
   Now, we substitute \(h = 0\) into one of the original distance equations:
   \[
   \sqrt{(0 - 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \sqrt{16 + k^2} = r + 1
   \]

   For the second circle:
   \[
   \sqrt{(0 + 4)^2 + k^2} = r + 1
   \]
   This gives the same equation, confirming \(h = 0\).

7. **Circle passing through \((0,5)\)**:
   The circle must also pass throug... [truncated]
