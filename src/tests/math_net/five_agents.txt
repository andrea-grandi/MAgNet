Thought: To find the number of circles tangent to both given circles and passing through the point (0,5), I will first determine the equations of the two circles. The first circle centered at (4,0) has the equation \((x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\) and the second at (-4,0) has \((x + 4)^2 + y^2 = 1\). Next, I will analyze the geometric relationships to identify potential tangent circles.

Thought: The next step is to find the distance from the point (0,5) to the centers of the two circles, which will help in determining the possible radii of the tangent circles. The distance to the center at (4,0) is \(\sqrt{(0-4)^2 + (5-0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 25} = \sqrt{41}\) and to (-4,0) is \(\sqrt{(0+4)^2 + (5-0)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 25} = \sqrt{41}\) as well. This symmetry suggests that the tangent circles will have a consistent relationship with these distances.

Thought: Now, I will calculate the possible radii for the tangent circles based on the distances to the centers of the given circles. Since the tangent circles must be externally tangent to both circles, the radius \( r \) of the tangent circles must satisfy the conditions \( r + 1 = \sqrt{41} \) for both circles. This leads to the equation \( r = \sqrt{41} - 1 \).

To find the number of circles that are tangent to both given circles and pass through the point (0,5), we have established the following:

1. The centers of the two circles are at (4,0) and (-4,0), both with a radius of 1.
2. The distance from the point (0,5) to each center is \(\sqrt{41}\).
3. For a circle to be tangent to both circles, its radius \( r \) must satisfy the equation \( r + 1 = \sqrt{41} \), leading to \( r = \sqrt{41} - 1 \).

Next, we need to determine how many circles can be constructed with this radius that are tangent to both given circles. 

The circles can be positioned either externally or internally relative to the given circles. Given the symmetry of the problem and the fact that the point (0,5) is above the x-axis, we can conclude that there are two possible tangent circles that can be drawn: one above the x-axis and one below it.

Thus, the final answer is:

Final Answer: 2
