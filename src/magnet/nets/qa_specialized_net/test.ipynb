      "Quantum entanglement is a fascinating phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become linked, such that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This occurs when particles interact in such a way that their quantum states become dependent on each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key points about quantum entanglement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Non-locality**: The most striking feature of entanglement is that changes to one particle's state are reflected in the other particle's state instantaneously, even if they are separated by large distances. This challenges our classical understanding of locality, where information cannot travel faster than the speed of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Quantum states**: When two particles are entangled, they can no longer be described independently of each other. Their combined quantum state is described by a single wavefunction. For instance, if two entangled electrons are created, measuring the spin of one will instantaneously determine the spin of the other, regardless of the distance between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Bell's theorem**: This set of results demonstrates that no local hidden variable theories can replicate the predictions of quantum mechanics regarding entanglement. Experiments confirming Bell’s theorem have consistently shown that the results of measurements on entangled particles align with quantum mechanics rather than classical expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Applications**: Quantum entanglement has practical applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. For example, it is the basis for quantum key distribution, allowing secure communication through entangled particles.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Measurement problem**: The entanglement phenomenon brings up questions about the nature of measurement in quantum mechanics. When you measure one of the entangled particles, the wavefunction collapses, and the state of the other particle is determined. This oddity leads to discussions about the role of the observer in quantum mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, quantum entanglement illustrates the complex and counterintuitive nature of quantum mechanics, revealing that at a fundamental level, the universe operates very differently than our everyday experiences would suggest.\n",
