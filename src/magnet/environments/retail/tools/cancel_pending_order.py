def cancel_pending_order(order_id: str, reason: str) -> str:
    """
    Cancel a pending order.

    If the order is already processed or delivered, it cannot be cancelled. The agent
    needs to explain the cancellation detail and ask for explicit user confirmation
    (yes/no) to proceed. If the user confirms, the order status will be changed to
    'cancelled' and the payment will be refunded. The refund will be added to the
    user's gift card balance immediately if the payment was made using a gift card,
    otherwise the refund would take 5-7 business days to process.

    Args:
        order_id: The order id, such as '#W0000000'. Be careful there is a '#'
                 symbol at the beginning of the order id.
        reason: The reason for cancellation, which should be either
               'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake'.

    Returns:
        A JSON string containing the updated order details after cancellation,
        or an error message.
