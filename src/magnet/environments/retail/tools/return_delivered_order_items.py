    """
    Return some items of a delivered order.

    The order status will be changed to 'return requested'. The agent needs to explain
    the return detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.
    The user will receive follow-up email for how and where to return the item.

    Args:
        order_id: The order id, such as '#W0000000'. Be careful there is a '#' symbol
                 at the beginning of the order id.
        item_ids: The item ids to be returned, each such as '1008292230'. There could
                 be duplicate items in the list.
        payment_method_id: The payment method id to pay or receive refund for the item
                          price difference, such as 'gift_card_0000000' or
                          'credit_card_0000000'. These can be looked up from the user
                          or order details.

    Returns:
        A JSON string containing the updated order details, or an error message.
